<h1>Asterisk</h1>
<h3>This Program Uses a nested for loop to print an Asterisk Pattern of various traingles when the program is being run</h3>

<h1>HighestAndLowestNumber</h1>
<h3>This Java program continuously prompts the user to enter integers and determines the largest and smallest numbers from the input. The loop continues until the user types "stop" to exit.</h3>

<h1>IntegerFactorial</h1>
<h3>This Java program calculates the factorial of a given integer. It uses Java's BigInteger class to handle large results for factorials of large numbers, as factorials grow rapidly in size.</h3>

<h1>IntegerFactors</h1>
<h3>This Java program prompts the user to enter an integer and then prints out all the factors of the entered number. A factor of a number is any integer that divides the number without leaving a remainder.</h3>

<h1>MysteryGameLoop</h1>
<h3>This is a simple number guessing game written in Java. The computer randomly selects a number between 0 and 10, and the user has three chances to guess it. The game provides a caution which states if the guess is too high or too low.</h3>

<h1>MysteryGameLoopFour.java</h1>
<h3>This Java program is an advanced version of a number guessing game. The computer selects a random number between 0 and 10, and the user attempts to guess it. If the user guesses incorrectly three times, the mystery number is changed. The game continues until the user guesses correctly or makes 20 incorrect attempts.</h3>

<h1>MysteryGameLoopThree</h1>
<h3>This is a dynamic twist on the classic number guessing game. The user must guess a number between 0 and 10, randomly selected by the computer. The twist: every 3 incorrect guesses, the mystery number changes, making the game more challenging and unpredictable.</h3>

<h1>MysteryGameLoopTwo</h1>
<h3>This is a simple number guessing game. The program randomly selects a number between 0 and 10, and the user keeps guessing until they get it right. There's no fixed number of guessesâ€”just keep going until you win!</h3>

<h1>NaturalNumbers</h1>
<h3>This Java program prints the first 10 natural numbers (from 1 to 10) and calculates their sum. It's a basic example that demonstrates the use of loops and simple arithmetic.</h3>

<h1>NumberPattern</h1>
<h3>This Java program generates and prints a number triangle pattern, referred to as Pattern A. The pattern displays an incremental number of digits on each new line, forming a triangular structure.</h3>

<h1>NumberPatternFour</h1>
<h3>This Java program prints a right-aligned descending number triangle, referred to as Pattern D. The numbers start from 1 and reduce in length each line, while spaces increase on the left, creating a right-justified triangle.</h3>

<h1>NumberPatternThree</h1>
<h3>This Java program prints Pattern C, a right-aligned descending number triangle where each row starts from the current row number and counts down to 1. The result is a staircase-like structure aligned to the right.</h3>

<h1>NumberPatternTwo</h1>
<h3>This Java program prints Pattern B, an inverted left-aligned triangle made of ascending numbers. Each line starts from 1 and ends at a number that decreases with each row.</h3>

<h1>PowerInteger</h1>
<h3>This Java program prints a table of values showing a, b, and a raised to the power of b (a^b), where:
a ranges from 1 to 5
b = a + 1
It uses BigInteger to handle large results beyond the range of primitive integer types.</h3>

<h1>PrimeNumber</h1>
<h3>This Java program checks if a given number is a prime number. A prime number is only divisible by 1 and itself. The program prompts the user to enter a positive integer and determines if the number is prime or not.</h3>

<h1>RaiseToPowerInteger</h1>
<h3>This Java program calculates the result of raising a given integer to a specified exponent. It uses a while loop to repeatedly multiply the base number by itself for the given number of times (exponent), and it handles large numbers with BigInteger.</h3>

<h1>SumOfNumberLoop</h1>
<h3>This Java program repeatedly asks the user to input two integers, computes their sum, and then asks if they would like to continue or stop. The program continues until the user opts to stop by entering anything other than "yes."</h3>
